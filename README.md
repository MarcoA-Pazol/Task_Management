"""Project Title: Task Manager

Client Requirements:

Background:
Our company is looking for a simple task management system to help our employees organize their tasks effectively. We have tried several off-the-shelf solutions, but they don't quite fit our needs. We believe a custom solution tailored to our workflow would be more efficient.

Features:
User Authentication:
Users should be able to sign up with a unique username and password.
Users should be able to log in securely to access their account.

Task Management:
Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level.
Tasks should be categorized into different projects or categories.

Task Assignment:
Users should be able to assign tasks to themselves or other users within the system.
Assigned users should receive notifications when a new task is assigned to them.

Task Status Tracking:
Tasks should have different statuses such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
Users should be able to update the status of their tasks.

Search and Filter:
Users should be able to search for tasks by title, description, or tags.
Users should be able to filter tasks based on criteria such as status, priority, or due date.

User Dashboard:
Users should have a personalized dashboard displaying their tasks, upcoming deadlines, and any pending assignments.
The dashboard should provide an overview of the user's workload and productivity.

Notification System:
Users should receive email or in-app notifications for important updates such as task assignments or approaching deadlines.

Additional Requirements:
The system should be responsive and accessible from both desktop and mobile devices.
Data should be stored securely and backed up regularly to prevent loss.
The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly to encourage adoption among employees.
The project should be completed within a specified timeline of 4 weeks.

Evaluation Criteria:
The system should meet all specified requirements outlined by the client.
The system should be bug-free and demonstrate robust functionality.
The user interface should be aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.
The project should be completed within the agreed-upon timeline.


Frontend Implementation:
Technology Stack:
The frontend should be implemented using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Responsive Design:
The application should be responsive and accessible from various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Use media queries and responsive design principles to ensure a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.

User Interface Components:
Design and implement intuitive user interface components for tasks, projects, notifications, etc.
Utilize React component-based architecture to ensure modularity and reusability of UI elements.

Navigation:
Implement a clear and intuitive navigation system that allows users to easily switch between different views such as task lists, project views, and user dashboard.
Include breadcrumbs or a menu for hierarchical navigation.

Forms and Inputs:
Design user-friendly forms for creating and editing tasks, projects, and user profiles.
Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and provide helpful error messages.

Task Visualization:
Display tasks in a visually appealing manner, including details such as title, description, due date, priority, status, etc.
Use color-coded labels or icons to represent different task properties (e.g., priority level, status).


Design Guidelines:
Color Scheme:
Choose a professional and visually pleasing color scheme that promotes productivity and focus.
Consider using a combination of neutral colors for backgrounds and vibrant colors for interactive elements.
Avoid overly bright or distracting colors that may strain the eyes.

Typography:
Select clear and legible fonts for both headings and body text.
Use font sizes and weights to emphasize important information and hierarchy within the interface.

Layout and Spacing:
Design layouts with ample white space to improve readability and visual clarity.
Maintain consistent spacing between elements to create a harmonious and balanced design.

Visual Elements:
Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user interactions and provide feedback.
Use icons and illustrations judiciously to aid navigation and convey information efficiently.
